    "There are a few background tasks that you should do while we go over the introduction, as they may take 2-5 minutes for your laptop to complete, depending on your current setup and the event WiFi\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE 1:** If you haven't completed the setup steps in the [README.md](../README.md) then please do so now -- the Python environment is 1.5-2.5GB and there are 5GB of models to download. [https://github.com/ijstokes/tutorial-local-llm/](https://github.com/ijstokes/tutorial-local-llm/)\n",

    "**NOTE 2:** For everyone who prepared your environment *before* the start of the tutorial, please take two actions now:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pull the latest version of the repository, as there may have been some last minute updates:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git pull\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Following that, please update your environment with one of the two commands below depending on whether you use Conda/Mamba or UV:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mamba env update -f environment.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "or\n",

    "uv add -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note 3:** Everyone should have a few terminal windows open, in the tutorial directory, all with the tutorial Python environment activated (see [README.md](../README.md)).  Additionally you should have a Jupyter notebook session up and running **also** using the tutorial Python environment `tutorial-local-llm`."
